# A simple data set

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
hts <- read_csv("./datasets/heights.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
```

I've loaded the data into a tibble named "hts" that has a column (variable) named "heights" using `read_csv()` from the tidyverse:
```{r}
hts
```
These are the heights of 100 female humans (in cm). We can tell much from just looking at this long list of numbers, we will make a **histogram** of the numbers.

```{r}
ggplot(hts, aes(x = heights)) + geom_histogram(fill = "gray", color = "black", binwidth = 2)
```
